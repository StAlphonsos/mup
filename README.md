# mup #

mup is a perl interface to [mu](http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/)
([GitHub](https://github.com/djcb/mu)), a Maildir indexing and
search system that also implements the core functionality needed
by pretty much any MUA.

mup replicates the API described in the
[mu-server(1)](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/mu-server.1.html) man page in the standard Perly style.
